Hello and welcome to my tuple out dice game.
This README serves to give you a guide on how to play this game.

When you run the program in your terminal you should get a message
that asks Player 1 to press any key to begin the roll.
No matter what you put in, the game will begin.
The program will roll 3 dices so it will display 3 different
numbers choosen from the values 1-6 like regular dice.
If at least 1 of the 3 numbers is different from the others,
then you'll have the option to reroll. However, if you roll
3 numbers that are all the same you "tuple out" meaning 
you automatically loose by default.

After you finish your rolls, your score will be calculated 
by adding together the 3 numbers you rolled (eg. a roll of 2, 3, and 4 
would result in a score of 9). After that Player 2 will repeat the 
same steps. After both players have rolled, the program will announce 
a winner based on who had a higher score.

Things to note are that if one player "tuples out" (roll 3 of the same
numbers) the program will automatically end so you'll have to rerun
the program to play again. Another thing is that if you ever want to 
exit the program mid game then pres ctrl + c and it will perform
a keyboard interrupt that automatically exits you from the game.

Now that you know all this, enjoy playing the game.
